            <h2><strong>Dash Albert</strong></h2>
            <img src="images/Dash3.png" alt="Dash" width="200">
            <p>Born on Sep 30, 2017, Dash is a toy miniature schnauzer. His white coat makes him a
                non-traditional schnauzer, and his size is much smaller than the typical mini-schnauzer. Weighing 8lb
                3oz on his first birthday, Dash has reached his full size. </p>
            <p>He's an independent soul but loves to snuggle when he's tired. He tolerates his younger brother because
                they love to play and run around the yard together, even though it's obvious he doesn't care for Duke's
                reaction to every noise around them. </p>

            <h2>Duke Windsor</h2>
            <img src="images/duke2.png" alt="Duke" width="200">
            <p>Duke is a mix of Maltese and Shih Tsu, although he's more Shih Tzu than Maltese. Born on Jan 1,
                2018, Duke is almost double the size of Dash, and currently weighs in at 14.5lbs. He's is very
                protective of his people, and is determined to make sure we all hear the various noises outside. </p>
            <p>As the saying goes, his bark is way worse than his bite, as he's really a snuggly dog who loves to be
                held hang with his people. He may be the bigger dog, but he knows Dash is the alpha dog.</p>

            <h2>The Boys</h2>
            <img src="images/Furbabies2.png" alt="TheBoys" width="200">
            <p>These two are buddies and love to play outside in the morning, and sleep most of the day. They've only
                been together since March, but do not like being separated. So we now have all of their appointments
                together to prevent the doggie-meltown when the other is not in the house. Oh, and they love baby
                Jaime. :)</p>
